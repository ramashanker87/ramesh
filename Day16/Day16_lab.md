Create Service

---

# Lab 7: Verify Deployment

ECS → Services

Verify:

- Running Tasks = 1
- Service Status = Active

---

# Lab 8: Test Application

Open:

http://ALB-DNS-NAME

Expected:

Hello from Docker and Amazon ECR!

---

# Lab 9: View Running Tasks

ECS → Cluster → Tasks

Record:

- Task ARN
- Task Status
- Task IP Address

---

# Lab 10: Monitor Using CloudWatch

CloudWatch → Metrics

View:

- CPU Utilization
- Memory Utilization

Create Dashboard:

Name:
ecs-training-dashboard

Add:
- CPU Graph
- Memory Graph

---

# Lab 11: View Application Logs

CloudWatch → Log Groups

Locate:

/ecs/hello-task

Review:
- Startup Logs
- Request Logs
- Errors

---

# Lab 12: Scale Service

Update Service

Desired Tasks:

1 → 2

Verify:

Two tasks running.

Refresh application.

Observe Load Balancing.

---

# Lab 13: Configure Auto Scaling

ECS Service → Auto Scaling

Minimum:
1

Maximum:
4

Target CPU:
70%

Save Configuration

---

# Lab 14: Cleanup Resources

Delete:

- ECS Service
- ECS Cluster
- ALB
- Target Group
- Security Group

Verify no charges remain.

---

# Challenge Exercise
